# guessture

This library is a Rust implementation of the [$1 Unistroke Recognizer algorithm](https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/proj/dollar/index.html). Given a set of template gestures, this library can compare
2d paths of points to those templates and report how closely they match.

This library's API surface is smallâ€”it exposes types for recording path data (`Path2D`), storing
normalized gesture templates (`Template`), and matching a path aginst templates (`find_matching_template`/`find_matching_template_with_defaults`). Integration with user input toolkits is left to
other libraries as an exercise for the reader.
